# RT-RAMSIS Application Settings Template
#
# These are settings that are specific to the application instance and define
# global parameters which are independent of the currently loaded project.
#
# To use this file, rename it to settings.yml and copy it to an appropriate
# location. RT-RAMSIS will look for it in the cwd as well as in all typical
# platform specific application configuration locations (see AppConfigLocation
# at https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qstandardpaths.html#StandardLocation-enum).
