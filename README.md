# HERMES - *Hub for Earthquake foRecasts ManagEment and Scheduling*
Â©2024 ETH Zurich

## Overview
This project is under active development. The goal is to provide an orchestration and scheduling platform for earthquake forecast models. 

For v1 of the project, see the [gitlab repository](https://gitlab.seismo.ethz.ch/indu/rt-ramsis)

## Installation
This installation instruction is merely a recommendation for a user of the software. Depending on your preferences and knowledge, you are free to choose a different setup.


### 1. Install Docker
Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### 2. Create a working directory with a Python virtual environment
Required Python version is 3.12
```
mkdir hermes-project && cd hermes-project
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
```

### 3. Clone the repository into a subfolder
```
git clone https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/hermes.git src/hermes
```

### 4. Install the required Python packages
```
pip install -e src/hermes
```

### 5. Start the Prefect Service
After the successful installation of Docker, you can start the Prefect service with the following command:
```
docker compose -f src/hermes/compose-prefect.yaml up -d
```
If you want to set a more secure password, you can pass it as an environment variable:
```
PREFECT_PASSWORD=mytopsecretpass docker compose -f src/hermes/compose-prefect.yaml up -d
```

### 5. Configure environment file
```
cp src/hermes/.env.example .env
```
As a quick test setup, the configuration works as is, but is not secure. Please change the credentials, ports and connection strings in the .env file.

### 6. Start the HERMES database services
```
docker compose --env-file .env -f src/hermes/compose-database.yaml up -d
```

### 7. Install the models
```
git clone https://gitlab.seismo.ethz.ch/indu/em1.git src/em1
git clone https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/etas.git src/etas

pip install -e src/em1
pip install -e src/etas
```

### 8. Start with example configuration and data
```
cp -r src/hermes/examples .
```
Update the absolute path `fdsnws_url` in the `examples/induced/forecastseries.json` file to the path of the `examples/induced` folder.

### 9. Initialize the database
```
hermes db init
```
This only needs to be done once. In case you want to delete all data and start from scratch, you can run `hermes db purge` and then `hermes db init` again.

### 10. Load an example configuration
```
hermes projects create project_induced --config examples/induced/project.json
hermes forecastseries create fs_induced --config examples/induced/forecastseries.json --project project_induced
hermes injectionplans create default --forecastseries fs_induced --file examples/induced/multiply_template.json
hermes models create em1 --config examples/induced/model_config.json
```

The CLI can be used to interact with the HERMES service. For a list of available commands, run `hermes --help`. Most commands have a `--help` option to show the available options.

Most setting should be self-explanatory, but more information can be found in the [concepts documentation](https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/hermes/blob/main/docs/concepts.md).

A more detailed of the InjectionPlan configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/hermes/blob/main/docs/injectionplan.md).

### 11. Run a single forecast using the CLI
```
hermes forecasts run fs_induced --start 2022-04-21T15:00:00 --end 2022-04-21T18:00:00 --local
```
This starts a single forecast directly on the local machine. 

### 12. (Optional) Schedule forecasts or execute "replays".
To use advanced features like scheduling, it is necessary to start a process which "serves" the forecastseries. 
```
hermes forecasts serve fs_induced
```
Once this process is running, you can "send" a forecast to the service using the above command without the `--local` flag.
```
hermes forecasts run fs_induced --start 2022-04-21T15:00:00 --end 2022-04-21T18:00:00
```
This will again execute a single forecast, but this time it will be executed by the service. This now allows us to create a schedule for the forecastseries, which will automatically execute forecasts at the specified times. More information about the schedule settings can be found [here](https://github.com/swiss-seismological-service/hermes/blob/main/docs/concepts.md#forecast-series-scheduling).

```
hermes schedules create fs_induced --config examples/induced/schedule_replay.json
```
This schedule specifies forecasts in the past. Accordingly, no future forecasts will be executed, but the `catchup` command can be used to execute all forecasts as a "replay".
```
hermes schedules catchup fs_induced
```

__Note__ that a schedule can either lie in the past, the future, or both. The `catchup` command will only execute forecasts in the past, while the service will automatically execute forecasts in the future.

## Debugging
To view the forecasts and modelruns, currently only the webservice is available. The available endpoints are listed in the [API documentation](http://localhost:8000/docs).

To view the status of the latest forecasts, you can navigate to the following URL: [http://localhost:8000/v2/forecasts](http://localhost:8000/v2/forecasts).

To more easily debug the models, you can download the exact configuration and input files the modelrun used. You need copy the `oid` of the modelrun you'd like to download and then navigate to the following URL: `http://localhost:8000/v2/modelruns/{oid}/input`
